# Docs Typescript - Documenting Typescript made easy

Tool for documenting Typescript APIs using [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/pages/overview/intro/) with support for Markdown, MDX ([Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)) and HTML.
Alternative to [api-documenter](https://api-extractor.com/pages/setup/generating_docs/) and [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org) with better UX, much richer API presentation and support for single and multi page documentation.

## Documentation
