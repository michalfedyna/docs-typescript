# Docs Typescript - Documenting Typescript made easy

Tool for documenting Typescript based project APIs using [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/pages/overview/intro/) for Markdown, Docusaurus (MDX) and HTML.
With support for different frameworks. Alternative to [api-documenter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/api-documenter) but with better support for multi and single page documentation.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Markdown support
- [ ] Docusaurus (MDX) support
- [ ] HTML support
- [ ] Project website
- [ ] Create and use api-extractor alternative in form of [extractor-typescript](https://github.com/michalfedyna/extractor-typescript)

## Examples

- **Markdown**
- **Docusaurus (MDX)**
- **HTML**
