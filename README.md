# Docs Typescript - Documenting Typescript made easy

Tool for documenting Typescript APIs using [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/pages/overview/intro/) with support for Markdown, Docusaurus (MDX) and HTML.
Alternative to [api-documenter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/api-documenter) with much richer API presentation and better support for multi and single page documentation.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Markdown support
- [ ] Project website
- [ ] React support
- [ ] Docusaurus (MDX) support
- [ ] [Mermaid support](https://mermaid.js.org)
- [ ] HTML support
- [ ] Create and use api-extractor alternative in form of [extractor-typescript](https://github.com/michalfedyna/extractor-typescript)

## Examples
